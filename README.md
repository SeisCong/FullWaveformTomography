# FullWaveformAmbientNoiseTomography(FWANT)
The codes of full-waveform ambient noise tomography were orignially developed by Dr. Yang Shen and his seismology groups at the University of Rhode Island (https://web.uri.edu/gso/meet/yang-shen/). The code was then modified by Dr. Haiying Gao and by Dr. Cong Li at UMass Amherst. The codes will be maintained by both URI and UMass Amherst seismology groups in the future.
