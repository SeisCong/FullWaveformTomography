# FullWaveformTomography
The codes of full-waveform tomography were orignially developed by Dr. Yang Shen and his seismology groups at the University of Rhode Island (https://web.uri.edu/gso/meet/yang-shen/). The codes will be maintained by both URI and UMass Amherst seismology groups in the future.
